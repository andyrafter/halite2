Iterate over all moves before end of frame
- IF two ships are headed to same docked target on a similar plane, slow the one in front down so they arrive together

Planet choice
- If a larger planet is only a small distance further, then prefer this to a small planet as it has less total cost once spawning


Docking
--- dont dock if imminent attack is coming. Sitting duck.

Dock near spawn point or furthest point from nearest opponent.

Choose next planet based on average position of currently owned planets.
Prevents over spreading of resource becoming difficult to defend.



Defence
Widen defence to size of nearest planet if within small distance of planet?
e.g. if a ship spawns near planet and that planets docked planets are under attack, save them


Two player start of game strategy.

While no ships have been docked by enemy have a flag.
While we have not docked also flag that "the game" has not started yet
It takes 5 turns to dock 3 ships and 4 turns to make a ship
In 11 turns two ships will spawn and if the enemy sent three ships to attack from a distance of 11 turns away then they will very likely lose battle against 2 ships attacking and 5 ships absorbing damage

---- 2d math ---
Calculating adjustment angle to prevent collision

If bounding boxes dont overlap
find diff between bounding box edges


Angle between bounding box pointss

e.g for X axis only, if x bounds have no gap angle is direct up
if there is a gap you calculate that vector them thrust from the origin at that angle.

Optimise for used map sizes

240x160
264x176
288x192
312x208
336x224
360x240
384x256


----
If you approach at the right angle, can you destroy i.e. collide with two ships at once?
